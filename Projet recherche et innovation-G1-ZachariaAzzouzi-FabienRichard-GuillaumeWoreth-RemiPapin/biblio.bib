abstract={Simultaneous Localization And Mapping (SLAM) allows a mobile robot to be completely autonomous in an unknown environment and perform its tasks. The robot is able to create a map of its environment and at the same time locate itself. Real world environments however, are characterized by moving objects such as people, cars, robots and mobile furniture. In order for the robot to interact safely with these moving objects the robot would have to perform Detection And Tracking Of Moving Objects (DATMO). Moving object detection and tracking would eliminate errors in maps, resulting in a reliable map that would enable the robot to localize itself in the environment and execute its tasks. This paper provides a literature review of the techniques and sensors employed to allow a mobile robot to perform SLAM and DATMO.},
